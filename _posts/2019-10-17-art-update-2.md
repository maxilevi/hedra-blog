## WELCOME, WELCOME!

It has been some time since I spoke up. Normally, I lurk the discord in some minor state of
closed-door development on the game, so most of my work doesn't actually see the light of
reddit or any forum, but Zaph, as of me entering the main quest arc of development, said I
should post at least SOMETHING. Here it is; pardon the rambly format.

## LAST TIME WE SPOKE...

I was in the midst of a royal pile of props and set dressing. In fact, I still am, but in the process
of modeling, new locations have been introduced to the game archive. To start, villages are
now fleshed out. This basic house, for instance, is a solid marriage of architecture modeling
and handy set dressing.

Let's skip forward a bit to a more complex buildings...

![](https://i.imgur.com/qKT1v6m.jpg)

The two story commoner's house, third alternate 1-story common house and the witch hut.

Modeling comes inn three phases for most buildings. First I figure out what's going to be IN
them, and model all of those props and set dressing first, then I floorplan the roam space, and
then I model around the needs of the player and npcs. That way everything is not too
spacious and not too cozey, although there are some grovelings about not having enough
jump room here and there, but 'cest la vie.'

By modeling this way, we avoid the weird spacial paradox other rpg's (like TES4/5) where
sometimes you walk into a tiny building and end up in an expansive labyrinth of rooms. It
doesn't make sense, to be frank, but players accept it as just part of the game's quirks.

Weirdly enough, this introduces a bit of strain on the engine when ambitious building designs
are introduced to the world. One such building pushed back engine development a bit to
micromanage polygon loading in a faster way. This was none other than the nordic wizard's
tower.

After those issues were delt with however, we were able to finally begin working with
dungeon, crypt, and fortress concepts. These are still far off from being complete, but will add
some content specifically for people who are found of a good crawl every so often. The same
philosophy has been applied to these as the other buildings.

This is the first of what will be ten dungeons to roam around in, neatly built around the
objectives needed. Not too long, not too short, and the fights will be as brief or as long as
they need to once testing comes to play.

## SINCE WE LAST SPOKE...

The game has gotten a large cast of non-playable characters(enemies included) added to the
resource libraries. Some appear in towns for the private beta, but most we're still finding
places for as the project takes a temporary right-hand turn into the first main quest arc. Here
is just a small dosage of what is currently out there:

![](https://i.imgur.com/J6uPcy1.jpg)

Up until now, I have been purely working as a modeler on Hedra, but because end-game
content requiring custom animation rigs puts us outside of the time budget-production-wise,
I've switched to animation! Basically, from here on out, I'll be working on the bosses and new
creatures going into the game within the scope of the main quest arc, which encompasses a
Lich giving four parts of his horcrux/phylactery to fourish(?) multiverse lords in exchange for
them having a stake in the material plane real-estate. This of coarse causes all sorts of issues
and is the reason why you(hero) is in this twisted little world. Well enough of that...

![](https://i.imgur.com/4rM2fAs.jpg)

Animation starts a bit
like this... The old
tradition of studying
time divy'd up into
frames per second like
the old masters like
Tex and Walt used to
do, before a modeling
program is even
touched.


Notes are paired with concept
art to give me a visualization of
how a creature should move. As
such, those notes correspond to
the first of four main quest
bosses, Azathul the Miconian.

You remember what he looks
like from the npc preview sheet
right? He's this guy:

Anyways, after conceptualizing, frame-direction, and modeling, then it's rigging so all of that
written down data can be quickly animated. A skeleton, plus handles, is below for one of the
fungal biome creatures:
This doesn't include
conversions to motionbuilder,
blender, then cleanup of
conversion artifacts, and
then the final DAE output
that the game uses. As you
can see, **THERE ARE A LOT
OF STEPS** just to get just
one character in the game,
and that's before Zaph
scripts it in with C#.

As of the end of September and beginning of October 2019, it has been agreed that to tie the
game together and ultimately make everything worthwhile, we needed to develop a basic
motif for gameplay, not just infinite grinding and survival.

![](https://i.imgur.com/2TnXpJq.jpg)

As I said earlier, this is broken down into for monstrous creatures, each with a shard of the
soul of a lich that is plaguing the land with undead and whatnot. The four lords are:

![](https://i.imgur.com/Dwmisqv.jpg)

Azathul the Myconian, Penemue of the Sundered Tower....


![](https://i.imgur.com/bh8l7Kd.jpg) ![](https://i.imgur.com/CiiTq00.jpg)

The brothers Faus the Woodguard & Icari the Woodlord...

![](https://i.imgur.com/OPool54.jpg)

...and Saiinov of the Cosmos, forlorn deity of a now
dead planet.

![](https://i.imgur.com/CfPWkFp.jpg)

Each boss creature will have its own mini biome
rich with localized creatures and foley. For instance,
these trees and critters from Azathul's biome:

That ends this summary of what's been going on over the last half year of so on the art front.
If you want to see more, lurk the discord. We appreciate guests.
